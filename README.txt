MySQLi extension is needed for connecting to MySQL.
However, MySQL is not necessarily needed, because there is an option to save emails to a .txt file also.
I used XAMPP for running Apache server and MySQL.
I created MySQL database and table by using phpmyadmin at localhost/phpmyadmin.
The name of the database needs to be 'emails'.
The query needed for creating the table can be found in database.sql.
The source files need to be located in xampp/htdocs when using XAMPP.
